# Fine-Tuning:

Deeply trains the LLM on a specific task or domain, making it an expert in that area.
Needs lots of high-quality data for that task.
Great for accuracy but less flexible.

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

Lets the LLM access external knowledge sources (like documents) to answer questions.
Doesn't need as much specific data, but relies on the quality of the knowledge source.
More flexible for broader understanding but might be less accurate.

# Choosing the right approach:
Need high accuracy for a specific task? Fine-tune with lots of relevant data.
Limited data, but need access to broader knowledge? RAG with a good document collection.
